# 🔍 Reddit Sentiment Analysis System (Notebook-Based)

This project presents an end-to-end sentiment analysis system for Reddit comments, implemented entirely in a Jupyter notebook. It combines machine learning, system architecture planning, deployment strategy, and performance analysis in one streamlined document.

---

## ✅ Project Workflow (5 Steps)

### 1. 📊 **Exploratory Analysis & Feature Engineering**
- Load Reddit comment data.
- Preprocess using text cleaning, normalization.
- Extract features using TF-IDF and engineered metrics.

### 2. 🧠 **Model Training & Evaluation**
- Primary model: `Random Forest` (Accuracy: **87.18%**)
- Backup: `Logistic Regression`
- Ensemble Option: `Random Forest + Logistic Regression + XGBoost`
- Evaluated using accuracy, latency, and confidence scoring.

### 3. 🌐 **System Architecture Design**
- Microservices design with components:
  - FastAPI for API Gateway
  - MLflow for model management
  - Redis for caching, PostgreSQL for storage
  - Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring
- Architecture visualized via a custom diagram

### 4. 🔐 **Security, Compliance & Monitoring**
- JWT authentication, TLS encryption, audit logging
- GDPR compliance and data anonymization
- Real-time performance tracking & alerts

### 5. 🚀 **Deployment, Cost Analysis & Roadmap**
- Blue-Green deployment, Docker-ready architecture
- Cost analysis showing 190% ROI
- 14-week roadmap divided into MVP, Production, Enhancement phases
